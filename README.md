# koth

King of the Hill (KotH) is an active cybersecurity competition in which multiple teams fight for control of a large vulnerable network, designed to give students experience performing and defending against penetration testing. Each team is given machines to defend, and must attack other team's boxes. 

## Front-End

This repository is solely the front-end for the competition - in order to run KotH, you will have to setup the network itself.

Check out the demo of the front end on github.io [here](https://kkevsterrr.github.io/koth/index.html)!
